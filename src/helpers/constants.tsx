    description: `A web3 social app with NFT invite system based on Merkle Trees. 
You can see where users read in real-time

I was a solo developer, CTO reviewed my code from time to time
I built both backend and frontend parts using MERN stack

Later we built invites system for future projects on top of that - dosu-invites
We generated a set of 512 AI images (imagine doing this in 2021)
Each image was stored in IPFS system, I hosted an IPFS node to do this
Because there were no IPFS providers or they were unreliable

Invites were stored in Merkle Tree - you could claim it and get an NFT from a set of 512 images
Each image was bound to ETH address. More images were claimed - more frames of the videos were shown
You could open invites.dosu.io/112 to see the frame and the owner`,

My team used React-Native-Web with Expo.
I made continuous integration by codepush updates and took responsibility for the app data in the App Store and Play Market. 
The frontend had a custom design, so I wrote everything by myself with fluent animations. 
I made infinite post feed and reddit-like comments section. I used AI services to generate pictures for users to keep them private. 
I also engineered random names generator with large dictionary. 
I implemented custom registration flow that involves YCombinator and Twitter API combined with ZK that runs directly on mobile phone`,
